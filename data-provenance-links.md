# Data provenance links

## Context

## Problem
We can't keep plots and tables in a database all the time to make sure we have the meta-data at hand. Provenance data has to become part of the plot file.

## Solution

Use exif to add meta information to plots. Exif meta can contain links to the version (ref) of the code that was used to produce this version of the plot
